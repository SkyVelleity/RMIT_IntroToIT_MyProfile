								<p>Hi, I’m Sky Velleity (surname can be pronounced Vee(/ˈviː/) for convenience), I have a broad interest in technology and industrial design, from retro micro computing to embedded systems, although am typically 
								non-fussed about consumer electronics.<br>
								I believe the beauty of computing comes from the moments the system fades compleatly into the background, totally out of mind, and entirely out of your way.<br>
								With the rise of ubiquitous, non-corporeal computing, I see a time not far from now when most users won’t even notice they are interacting with a computer at all.</p>

								<p>If I need to spend even a second thinking about a device in the decade or so span between acquiring and sunsetting it, there is room for improvement in its design.</p>

								<p>An iOS developer by trade, I try to identify and ease pressure points users feel in their day-to-day interactions with their personal computing devices.</p>
								
								<p>That aside, I do occasionally enjoy playing around with C on embedded systems, memory unsafe languages make me feel alive again.<br>
								(...as do mid-engine Roadsters, but I feel I hardly have the time for the poor things.)</p>

                                                <!-- Profile -->
                                                        <article id="profile">
                                                                <h2 class="major">Profile</h2>
								<h3>No photos.</h3>
								<p>I'll start by saying that if I at times seem a little reserved, that is most likely due to a very much intentional set of choices I have made regarding my privacy, founded in years of industry experience alongside heeding cautionary tales offered from individuals 
								much wiser than I could ever hope to be.<br>
								I believe that everyone's right to privacy does not end with employment or in academia, and have demonstrated that outcomes can be just as effectively achived without the sharing of personal information ultimatly irrelevant to the task at hand.<br>
								I have found such things, more often than not, only result in the propegation of historical biases, subconsious or otherwise, resulting in the perpetuation of discrimination.</p>
								
								<p>Once remote work became the new standard, I was able to question many historically heald beliefs as to how buisness should function. I found that keeping things strictly professional not only does not impact productivity, but can substancially increase it.<br>
								As such, I present a simple set of conditions to all of my clients: "All direct communication is to be text based; you are not entitled to video calls. If you value in my work and outcomes, I ask only that you consider now, if you will happily abide by these terms throughout our 
								professional relationship, otherwise, I respectfully request you look elsewhere."</p>
								<p>I have never been short for work</p>
								<p>I will operate in education with the professional standards I offer all my clients and associates, and should I face strong resistance, I ask only this:</p>
								<h3>When rating someone's academic performance, what good can come from an assessor knowing what a student looks like?</h3>
								
								<h2 class="major">With that out of the way...</h2>
								<h3>My interest and experience in I.T</h3>
								<p>My interest in IT comes from the truly profound ability such systems are capable of giving people to improve the world in instantly apparent ways, as well as the virtually limitless capacity for creative expression such systems enable. I view questions like this 
								as no different than asking an 18th century industrialist what their interest in Steel is. It is simply the substrate on which things are now built.<br>
								I view computers as nothing more than a means to an end, and like them more the less I have to think about them. A computer you are aware of is not doing its job.</p>
								<p>Although showing interest in all forms of technology from a younge age, my formal experiance in IT goes back to completing studies to be a Cisco Certified Networking Associate at Box Hill Institute in 2014, 
								from there I furthered my skills in software development with The C programming langage, primarily for embedded microcomputinng applications, as well as learning 6502 machine code as a primarily academic exercise.</p>
								<p>In 2020 I began developing software for mobile platforms, with a focus on iOS devices.</p>  
								<p></p>
								<h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
								<p>My consideration of RMIT came from a discussion with an alumni regarding the value a degree can serve in the workplace. While I argued that, with demonstrable skills, such things aren't nececary in order to achive my desired goals in life, however, they retorted:</p>
								<p>"Imagine you come across a perfect job offering, a truly once in a lifetime oppertunity, and although you are more capable of performing the role, you loose the position to a less capable candidate simply because they have a degree.<br>
								Alternativly, should you already have a job, and your manager is impressed with you, entirely supportive of you, so when you request a raise, they vouch for you to the accountants, however with a limited budget, raises are limited only to the most "qualified" employees, 
								as such, your manager is unable to justify the salary increase to the book keepers given your credentials."</p>
								<p>Put this way, the value of a degree was recontextualized to me. Not as a means to an end, but simply as grease along the way. I thought there was no better university in Australia to study at considering my interests, so RMIT was the natural choice.<br>
								Thus far, I have found it perfectly cromulent.</p>
								<p>During my studies, I expect to become aligned with current industry standards and best practices in a wide range of disciplines, increasing my agility for developing technlologies and reducing my mental inertia in relation to legacy methodologies.</p>




								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<p>Short of furthering my skills as an independant contractor, or joining a startup solving a hitherto unexplored problem, the former of which I am already doing, and the latter of which is impossible to even conceptulaise until a point at which such an oppertunity presents 
								itself, it is diffucult to describe my ideal job, as I do not believe such a role currently exists. I only hope that once it does, I am more than ready to jump on the oppertunity.</p>
								<p>But, for the sake of discussion, there is value in setting a minimum target that might be required for such a role.<br>
								I would want to be working in a senior position in a respectable company, somewhere I could learn and grow from my peers, and would allow for invaluable networking oppertunites. Unfortunatly, oppertunities in my domain of interest are limited, but I did 
								find a couple of roles that seem appropriate, so I have selected one here:<br>
								<a href=https://jobs.apple.com/en-au/details/200380436/senior-engineer-apple-arcade>Senior Engineer, Apple Arcade</a> <a href="#snapshot">(Snapshot)</a></p>
								<p>This position involves front-end UX development as well as application logic, as well as development of middleware for the use of other third party developers allowing them to interface with the underlying OS and platform libraries.<br>
								Requiring three years experience, it's by no means so far out of reach that it's unimaginable, however I would still need far more experience than I currently have with the platforms at hand before I would feel it would be appropriate to apply for such a role.<br>
								The position would require expeience with either, although preferably both, the Swift and Objective-C programming languages, the former I have a lot of, the latter I have a moderate familiarity with, 
								 a strong understanding of Object Oriented Programming principles, which I have,  as well as an understanding of the platform frameworks, a nececity for mobile development on Apple platforms, which can be considered a given, 
								as well as optimisation skills, which I have, asynchronous programming abilities, a discipline I currently have about a year's experience with, networking stacks and protocols, which I learned extensivly in 2014, API design, maintanance and doccumentation, all of which I have 
								experience with from my own software, and an applicant would benefit from a cursory understanding of JavaScript based technologies and frameworks, which I have dabbled with but would rather not specialise in.</p>
								<p>I expect that, as I develop increasingly complex applications and solutions, the skills of which I am not yet fluent will be required more and more frequently, and, with practice, I will refine these skills to a satisfactor level.</p>
										
								<h2 class="major">Personality Tests</h2>
								<h3>Boy howdy mine sure is being tested.</h3>
								<p>Jokes aside, I've found people's reaction to being asked to perfoma a MBTI far more insigtful than anything the tests themselves have ever reavealed, but nevertheless, my results are most often INTJ, INTJ-A on the test specified today, an Aquarius, and a dog lover.<br>
								Results vary from test to test, time of day, if I answer before or after going on a walk, and are most impacted by current hydration levels.</p>
								<p>In addition, I found an "Online learning style test", three in fact, the first Visual/Tactile, the second Auditory, and the last Multimodal. I tried answering as consistantly as possible between tests, however have not been able to derive meaning from the results other than 
								that the way I learn most effectivly varies based on the type of information I am trying to learn.</p>
								<p>For my self-selected test, I chose a simple WPM calculator, as it has been some time since I last tried, and got a modest 64 words per minute, which put me around the 70th percentile.</p>
								<p>To me, the results of these tests are mostly meaningless, the effort required to derive meaningful insight from such things far exceeds that required for regular introspection.<br>
								I will not comment authoritativly, however I beleived that for quite some time now, "learning styles" have been shown to be nothing more than placebo at best and activly harmful at worst, however, like many things, reguardless of how unscientific they are shown to be, 
								HR departments will still squeeze them for all they can get out of them.<br>
								I have found, however, that being able to readily demonstrate a WPM count in the 60's can be quite conducive to further employment.</p>
								<p>I doubt these tests will meaningfully influence team behaviour, as there are usually other, more effective ways of delegating more appropriate roles, however should my team members desire to base such decisions off these test results, I am more than happy 
								to abide by their wishes.</p>

								<h3>Questionably legal. Morally and ethically sound</h3>
								<p>Have you ever forgotten to take your bin out one week?<br>
								Got an unwanted surplus of garbage?<br>
								This could bring the solace you need!</p>
								
								<p>BinPing is built from a hardware and software fusion allowing for long-range notifications whenever your bin has been collected, allowing you to refil your bin and move it to a location for it to be collected a second time in one day!
								Maybe on the other side of the street, maybe a nearby intersection, but the important part is you'll be able to empty it a second, or even third time in one day, rightfully making up for the collection you missed the week prior.</p>
								<p>While most Internet-of-Things devices would be limited by WiFi range, or otherwise require hubs for long-distance sensing, BinPing is designed on top of the open, secure Find My networking standard, 
								allowing for nearly global reach! BinPing will be able to communicate with a SmartBin™ 
								so long as it is in proximity to a WAN connected device on the Find My Network.</p>

								<p>The wholistic solution works by pairing an app installed on the user's device with a hardware sensor installed on the bin; the sensor is able to detect movement, both translation and rotation, and when it detects it has been emptied (or knocked over) 
								it will relay this information to the Find My network, which a microservice will poll at regular intervals, and once a collection is detected, it will send a push notification the the user's registered device, alerting them their bin is now empty, knocked over, or destroyed!</p>
								
								<p>The app also allows users to enter their bin schedule, reminding them the night before to put their bins out, and which bins to put out.</p>

								<h3>Built to solve one very, very annoying problem</h3>
								<p>APFixS is an iOS app built with the sole purpose of mitigating unintentional filename duplications on the iOS and iPadOS platforms</p>
								
								<p>iOS apps, both first and third party, tend to store collections of media in an abstracted manner, oftentimes storing the files with a UUID for their filename, and other metadata, including former filenames, stored in a database, alongside their UUID.<br> 
								This allows for a situation in which multiple files of equal hierarchy to have the same filename string attributed to them.<br>
								If such a selection of files are exported in bulk to the filesystem, an error can occur where multiple files are written to the same directory, with their original filenames applied, resulting in a directory with two unique files that share one filename.<br>
								This results in a uniquely terrible situation, in which if this directory is copied to another filesystem that does not support duplicate filenames, one of the files may be silently lost.</p>
								
								<p>APFixS proposes a solution to this, by installing an application on a target device, allowing a user to quickly check a directory for any filename conflicts, and, should any exist, allow the user to easily rename any conflicting files, 
								either on a case-by-case basis or programmatically as per the user's requirements.</p>
								<p>Once all conflicts are rectified, the user will be clearly notified of this, so they know it is safe to proceed in transfering the directory structure to an external storage medium.</p> 
								
								<p>There are a number of possible challenegs that may arrise while creating this app, the most significat of which, I anticipate, will be accuratly itemising files in a directory without accidentally ignoring duplicates during enumeration.
								I anticipate that many libraries which rely on filenames as object identifiers or tags may struggle to safely handle directory structures in such invalid states. As such, lower level filesystem access may be required, 
								which may not be possible on the platform at hand.<br>
								The last thing I would want to do is give people false confidence in the safety of their data, as such it isn't enough for the app to simply appear to be working, it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt that it will catch all edge cases.</p>
								<p>This is, to say the least, non-trivial.</p>

								<h3>3D Printers used to have a problem: They caught fire too much. Now? They're not exciting enough.<br>Let's fix that.</h3>
								<p>In the days of yore, you knew a print had failed because you caught the distinctive scent of deflagrating ABS plastic as well as hundreds of hours of precision tuning going up in smoke, but with advances in printer technology, a failed print may be much less apparent.<br>
								While there are many benefits of modern technologies such as thermal runaway detection and AI-based visual print observation, having your printer gracefully terminate a print at the first sign of a problem has taken the excitement that went hand in hand with early 
								hobyiest rapid manufacturing away from the discipline. Rather than waking up to smoke alarms and the fire department kicking down your door, all you get is a silently delivered push notification at 4:16 AM that the print was terminated due to a "Potential anomaly".<br>
								The only excitement to be had is checking your printer once you wake up to find if it reliably finished your print, or if it reliably entered a known safe state in order to prevent damages.</p>
								<p>We can change that.</p>
								<h3>With PrinterFi, we're bringing the Fire back into 3D Printing!</h3>
								<p>Using an advanced fusion of artificial inteligence, edge computing hardware, and personal software, you too can live with the persistantly elevated heart rate of a 3D printing enthusiast from the early 2010's!<br>
								Using a multi-targeted approach, we can provide the user with the constantly, adrenaline fueled fight-or-flight response that comes with immitating precision industrual equptment with nothing more than scavanged stepper motors, aluminium channel, and some nicrome wire.<br>
								First, and most importanly, the system will not compromise any of the existing safetly mechanisms in place designed to reduce equipment damage, financial harm, or death; in fact, these advancements are leveraged in order to provide an authentic, nostalgia-invoking experience 
								to all! After any safetly mechanism detects a fault, not only will the print safely and reliably  haulted in a determanistic manner, leaving the printer itself in a failsafe condition, a range of harmless, yet addrenaline inducing activities can be initiated!</p>

								<p>One such activity, in the spirit of being woken by a fire suppression system, would be for a pneumatically pressurised tube of Energy Drink placed over the bedhead of the user to be releasaed, not only urgently waking them in a caffinated mist, 
								but ruining all of their bedding, replacing the time historically spent repairing and recalibrating printers with laundering their sheets, and giving them pause to think next time they're confident in the adheasion of the first layer of a print before going to bed.</p>
								
								<p>An alternative is combining a companion application on the user's device with the information aggregated by the system, simulating their phone's built in Emergency Alert System in the event of a print failure. Flood? Hurricane? Hot-end blocked?<br>
								You'll really have pause to think before you brush that alert off as a simple anomalous weather event!</p>

								<p>And just for old times sake, why not emulate a classic breaker trip? Have all the IoT connected equiptment in your house shut off alongside your printer whenever it encounters a watchdog reset!</p>

								<p>The possibilities truly are endless with PrinterFi! So, with your support, we can put the Rapid Responce back in Rapid Prototyping!</p>
